# McK-P Content Management System

## Overview

This is the **CMS** that McK-P uses for our clients and we are open-sourcing it
in order to 1) allow other agencies to use it and 2) give full transparency around
how our clients' data is stored, accessed, and developed. 

## How to Build This Yourself?

Check out the [tutorial](./tutorial.md) that we wrote while building it to see
how you can build your own CMS!
